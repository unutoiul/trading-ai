What This Script Does
This script focuses specifically on identifying and analyzing momentum patterns between Bitcoin and Dogecoin:

1. Pattern Classification
The script identifies 10 distinct momentum patterns in Bitcoin:

Strong Upward Momentum: Sharp price increases with high RSI
Strong Downward Momentum: Sharp price decreases with low RSI
Volatility Breakout: Sudden increase in price volatility
Steady Climb: Consistent upward trend with low volatility
Steady Decline: Consistent downward trend with low volatility
RSI Divergence: Price increases while RSI decreases
MACD Crossover: MACD line crosses above signal line
Stochastic Oversold Bounce: Recovery from oversold conditions
RSI Overbought: RSI above 70
RSI Oversold: RSI below 30
2. Lag Analysis
For each pattern, the script:

Identifies all instances where the pattern occurs
Calculates DOGE returns at different lag intervals (1-20 minutes)
Determines the optimal lag where DOGE's response is strongest
Calculates correlation, average return, and win rate
3. Visualizations
The script generates multiple visualizations:

Pattern Lag Response Curves: Shows how DOGE responds to each pattern over time
Interactive Pattern Analysis: Comprehensive view of BTC patterns and DOGE responses
Pattern-Specific Analysis: Detailed examination of the top 3 most predictive patterns
4. Summary Report
A comprehensive text report with:

Details for each identified pattern
Optimal lag times
Statistical correlations
Win rates and expected returns
How to Interpret the Results
The most valuable insights will be:

Which BTC patterns most reliably predict DOGE movements
How long it typically takes for DOGE to respond (optimal lag)
The expected magnitude and direction of DOGE's response
The win rate (percentage of positive returns) for each pattern
This information forms the foundation for developing a trading strategy, which you mentioned you'd like to focus on later.
